HOW TO RUN FILE ON YOUR LOCAL SYSTEM.

1) first of all click on the fork button , showed in your github repo.


2) make a clone of this project..by running git clone <url> in your command prompt.
  
  
3)open the file into your text editor.


4) open your command prompt and dive into the project folder using basic cmd commands like -->
   pwd---->to show your current path.
   cd ---> change directory.
  ls -la---->for showing all the files in the folder.
  
 5)once you are inside your folder in cmd run the command---> nodemon app.js (to restart the server).
 and then you will see that "server is running on port 3000" will appear.

 6) then open your browser(suggested- google chrome) and type ----> localhost:3000.
 and then your project will open and take a look.
